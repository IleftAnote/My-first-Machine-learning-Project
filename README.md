# My-first-Machine-learning-Project
This is a project on training a machine learning model to predict the likelyhood of a customer leaving a bank for another bank.
After training the model, I have used streamlit to create a web app that can be presented to the client(bank personell) from where they can upload their customer dataset and perform some visualizations as well as predict if the customer will leave/churn or not, with the features used in training the ML model.
